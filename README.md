# homebridge-shelly-consumption

## Plugin description
This homebridge plugin provides the possibility to get the consumption values of **Shelly EM** and **Shelly 3EM** in Homekit. 
Because HomeKit doesn't support any consumption service, here the values are integrated as LightSensor-Service. So the unit of the value 
is Lux.

Actually, this only is a beta version and a very new plugin.
Should any errors occur, of course you can write to me via GitHub. Suggestions for improvement are welcome too.
Thanks a lot!
