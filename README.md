# Homebridge Platform Plugin

This homebridge plugin provides the possibility to get the consumption values of Shelly EM and Shelly 3EM in Homekit. 
Because HomeKit doesn't support any consumption service, here the values are integrated as LightSensor-Service. So the unit of the value 
is Lux.

Actually, this only is a beta version and a very new plugin.
Should any errors occur, of course you can write to me via GitHub. Suggestions for improvement are welcome too.
Thanks a lot!
